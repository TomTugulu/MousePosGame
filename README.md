# Mouse Position Game
A little game I made whilst practicing python. Gives you mouse co-ordinates to move your mouse to, aim is to get to 5. 

## Version 1:
	Basic game

## To-Do:
* [x] Coordinate Readout
* [x] Basic Scoring
* [ ] GUI
* [ ] More game-modes? (Close click?)
* [ ] Multiplayer? (This is a stretch, but possibly achievable)
